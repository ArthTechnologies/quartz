# Quartz

Quartz is a backend for Arth Panel, an open-source & self-hosted minecraft server panel. Quartz is meant to be run as a docker container, and is made with Node.


# How to Run
The reccomended way to run observer is in a docker container. You can pull the image with `docker pull arthmc/quartz:latest`, and run with `docker run -p 4000:4000 arthmc/quartz:latest`, with the `-p` flag exposing port 4000. The environment variables `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` can be used to connect to your discord app for signin with discord.

## Current State
Quartz only has basic auth so far and no account system, or server system, and is thus still in early developnment. 


## Why Arth Panel?
The main difference between an alternative like pufferpanel or pterodactyl is that it's meant to work in a way so that if an issue were to occur, you could easily just SSH into the machine and run the jar directly in a folder, so you know that your server's uptime is not dependant on a panel someone else made working flawlessly.
