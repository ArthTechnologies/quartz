# Quartz

Quartz is a backend for Arth Panel, a lightweight self-hosted Minecraft server panel. Quartz is meant to be run as a docker container, and is made with Node. For testing purposes, there is an instance of quartz you can use at https://api.arthmc.xyz/

## How to Run

1. Download the image from docker hub with the command `sudo docker pull arthmc/quartz:latest`
2. Run the image with `sudo docker run -p 4000:4000 -e STRIPE-KEY=yourstripekey arthmc/quartz:latest`. To change the port, replace the first 4000 with the port number you want.
3. **Pocketbase will also need to be installed.** While there is no official docker image, installing it locally is very easy. Just download their executable file, and run `./pocketbase serve --http "0.0.0.0:[port]"`.

## Why Arth Panel?

The main difference between an alternative like pufferpanel or pterodactyl is that it's meant to work in a way so that if an issue were to occur, you could easily just SSH into the machine and run the jar directly in a folder, so you know that your server's uptime is not dependant on a panel someone else made working flawlessly.
